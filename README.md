### A simple neural network using python
This Python code encompasses a modular design for constructing a straightforward neural network. It comprises various layer types, including fully connected, activation, convolutional, and flatten layers, integrated within a network class. Each layer utilizes both forward and backward propagation methods, along with activation functions like tanh and a loss function based on mean squared error.

The code further demonstrates the application of neural networks for both the XOR problem and the MNIST dataset. Various examples are presented, including a fully connected neural network, a convolutional neural network (CNN), and a CNN with convolutional layers specifically tailored for the MNIST dataset.

### **Training a hybrid quantum-classical neural network for binary classification.**
The quantum circuit is used to extract non-linear features from the input data, and the classical neural network is used to combine these features and make predictions. The code demonstrates how quantum circuits can be integrated with classical neural networks to improve the performance of machine learning models on complex tasks.

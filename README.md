## A simple neural network using python
This Python code encompasses a modular design for constructing a straightforward neural network. It comprises various layer types, including fully connected, activation, convolutional, and flatten layers, integrated within a network class. Each layer utilizes both forward and backward propagation methods, along with activation functions like tanh and a loss function based on mean squared error.

The code further demonstrates the application of neural networks for both the XOR problem and the MNIST dataset. Various examples are presented, including a fully connected neural network, a convolutional neural network (CNN), and a CNN with convolutional layers specifically tailored for the MNIST dataset.
